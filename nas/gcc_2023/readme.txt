Here, in this directory/folder.. I have added modified nas.h and windows 64 bit NAS.EXE (old and new) samples which have been built with TDM-GCC-64 GCC 10 compiler suit for windows.
There was a 'long' to 'long long' conversion (oversize) problem which cause to wrong opcodes in the output (a.out) object file of the sample asm file.
After converting 'long' size definitions to 'long long' in the nas.h source file, the result, NAS.EXE has assembled 'sample.asm' with correct opcodes. ('status.txt' is a stderr redirection file here, which helped me what i need to correct in 'nas.h' file for compiling this assembler source with gcc 10 compiler suite for windows. You can see screenshots and also 'nasm.bat' and 'status.txt' and 'nas.h' files for details.) 
I have compared NAS.EXE output with NASM.EXE output (of course unix-bsd assembler -before GAS- synax different than NASM syntax but they are same. NASM output is a binary file but NAS output is a special (non-common) a.out object file.
(What for i have tried to build nas.exe and tested it with a sample asm file: I will port that -simple- unix ASSEMBLER to my TRDOS 386 and Retro UNIX 386 OS projects. This is a pre-work.)
